# My Jekyll Blog

## Description
This repo holds the contents of my blog at

[https://github.io/chasefranks](https://github.io/chasefranks)

It is a site built with [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com) and uses Bootstrap CSS for the look and feel.

## Getting Started

Feel free to clone this repo to try out Jekyll and see a working example, or fork it to start your own blog. 

To get up and running with Jekyll, follow the instructions here [installing Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/). You will also need a Ruby gem called Bundler

```bash
gem install bundler
```

After installing Jekyll and Bundler, getting this site built and running on a local test server is as easy as

```bash
cd chasefranks.github.io
bundle install
jekyll build
jekyll serve
```

```bundle install``` - uses the Ruby gem [*bundler*](http://bundler.io/rationale.html) to install the dependencies listed in Gemfile.

```jekyll build``` - builds the site

```jekyll serve``` - launches a web server to preview your changes locally. You should be able to see your site by launching a browser and going to http://localhost:4000.

### Adding Posts

Adding blog posts is simple. In the _posts/ folder, you will see the posts I have created. Just copy the 2016-07-29-new-post.md, change the date to the post date, set ```published: true```, add your content, and voila! the post should magically appear.

I'm still learning about Jekyll as I go, so I'll try my best to answer.
