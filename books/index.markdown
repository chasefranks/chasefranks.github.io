## An Aside on Technical Reading

I come from a mathematics background, and have spent a lot of time reading books, articles, etc. in great detail. I've even spent an entire day on understanding a single paragraph from a mathematical proof. Needless to say, there are many modes of reading, and each depends on the purpose you are trying to achieve and the density of what you are actually reading about.

I now work as a software developer, and my purposes and goals have changed. Now, I have a very concrete fixed objective I'm trying to achieve, and I tend not to linger in one place for too long! This obviously changes my relationship to books and learning. I used to treat a book like a fine wine, savoring the preface and first chapters, and wafting in the essence of each chapter.
