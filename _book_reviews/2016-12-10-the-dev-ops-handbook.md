intro: >
  In software development, there are traditionally two major 'camps': developers,
  who write new software and want to get it released to the customer as quickly as possible,
  and operations who must safely deploy the new software without breaking anything and causing
  an outage. This book and the DevOps movement in general is an attempt to break down the wall
  between these two groups and help them merge their processes so that new software is delivered safely
  and successfully. While this may sound like a simple management problem, in practice it's a complex
  issue that in addition to adopting new technology, involves company culture, building trust, and
  changing the way software is delivered.
