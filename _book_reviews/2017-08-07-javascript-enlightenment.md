intro: >
  Just wrapped up the free version of this book. This is not an exhaustive reference for Javascript, but is rather focused on delivering each topic with minimal discussion, preferring to focus on code examples instead. My goal when reading this book was to understand better how Javascript builds objects from a function constructor, in preparation for understanding ES6 classes. This is one of the first actual books I've read on core Javascript, and I thoroughly enjoyed and identified with the author's style.
