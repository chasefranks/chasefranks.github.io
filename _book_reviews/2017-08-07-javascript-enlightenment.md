intro: >
  Just wrapped up the free version of this book. This is not an exhaustive reference for Javascript, but is rather focused on delivering each topic with minimal discussion, preferring to focus on code examples instead. My goal when reading this book was to understand better how Javascript builds objects from a function constructor, in preparation for understanding ES6 classes. This is one of the first actual books I've read on core Javascript, and I thoroughly enjoyed and identified with the author's style.

# Intro

{{page.intro}}

That being said, I do not believe this book is sufficient on its own to learn Javascript. It is a great book for understanding the core of Javascript and how Javascript objects work.

## Javascript Objects

This is a short book, and the examples are very easy to understand. Chapters 1 - 8 focus on what I think is the core contribution of this book: an understanding of Javascript objects and the concept of inheritance. In fact, all of the previous chapters build up to chapter 8, which focuses on the `prototype` property of `Function` objects.

## Critique

I'm still learning about Javascript, and this book went straight to the heart of what I was trying to learn: Javascript objects. I like that the examples were so trivial and easy to understand, and led gradual to the end goal of understanding prototypal inheritance. I think my only critique is more of a feeling that this book is really just a quickstart or tutorial. I was reading other sources at the time, for example *Professional Javascript for Web Developers* by Nicholas Zakas (review to come), and when I come back to this book, I feel a better job could
