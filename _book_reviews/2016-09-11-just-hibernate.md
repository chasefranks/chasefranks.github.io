intro: >
  I recently joined a project which uses Spring Data JPA and MySQL for data storage, and was looking for a tutorial which
  focuses exclusively on the Hibernate framework without getting distracted by advanced use cases or other frameworks.
  I found this book is true to its title, and is a great book to get up and running with Hibernate in
  a short amount of time.
