  I'm probably wrapping up one of the most stressful and disappointing work assignments I've ever had in the work force. I'd like to document what my experience has been this past year in the hopes that those finding themselves in similar situations can find some comfort that they are not alone.

I started at my current assignment by accepting a conversion from contractor to full-time employee back in August of last year. One of the benefits offered to me was a signing bonus contingent upon my staying with the company for one year. At the time, I was thankful, but in retrospect I now realize that I should've placed more value in my freedom.

This has been a rough assignment for me for many reasons. You might think that I'm being overworked, or given impossible deadlines. Quite the opposite is true, and this is precisely what has been so difficult for me. I am currently being starved by my direct supervisor for work assignments that align with my current skill set and goals. I go home at the end of every day exhausted. Instead of having a steady flow of work assignments that give my day structure and routine, and help make the time pass in a bearable manner marked by regular and well-defined accomplishments, I almost never know what the next day will be like as far as work goes. A lot of the time, I have nothing assigned to me, forcing me to strategically plan breaks that take me out of the office so I can kill some time and keep from going crazy. Sometimes I need to get away from staring at my monitor pretending to work. I bring a lot of frustration home with me in my attempt to work out what is going on in my life and why people are behaving the way they are towards me. It keeps me up at night, and makes me groggy and ill-tempered the next day. I have to admit that this is a source of shame for me, and to my family, I am sorry.

I emphasize that in my workplace which is at a publicly owned company, it is the influence of individual managers that matter the most. They can literally make, or in this case, break you, and there is nothing you can do about it. I've had many issues while working for this company, but my latest difficulty started about a month ago when I wrote a memo to my direct supervisor and his manager, where I expressed concern that I regularly did not have anything to work on. I felt my skills as a developer beginning to languish, and noticed that others on my team did have little secret projects they were working on when I was clueless on what I was supposed to be doing. In the memo, I made several suggestions to them about how to improve transparency and ensure that everyone on the team was getting used; from having a visible Kanban board, to at least tracking user stories[^1]  with some type of project management system. I felt that my memo was articulate, polite, and expressive. My suggestions were not novel, they were practices that were being employed by the two previous teams I had worked on, and were all concerned with transparency. I had a brief meeting with my direct supervisor and his manager, and somehow in a later private discussion, they concluded the matter was closed. Even though my concerns were not addressed (effectively sanctioning that employees would be paid for doing nothing) I respect the chain of management and so left the last word to those with more responsibility.

Since then, my manager has simply not included me in meetings for new upcoming projects. My team doesn't really talk to me anymore, and I get this weird vibe whenever I'm in the office. People sort of pretend that I'm not there. It's a very disheartening dynamic. We all sit at these open tables within feet of one another[^2], so you are basically forced to hear and see what is going on around you because it's literally in your face. I can hear when new projects are starting up based on the conversations around me. Still, my team finds a way to be sneaky and exclude me from participating in meetings. One morning, I came in and noticed they were rallying together for a meeting. I checked my calendar and noticed I didn't have an invite, so I turned around and asked them if I was missing a meeting I needed to be at. The reply was something to the effect of "Well I don't know, I just saw the invite on my calendar". Then everyone just sort of shuffled off, carefully avoiding eye contact with me. It's clear that a conscious decision was made to keep me off the invite list.

I don't blame them. I am coming to realize that they are at risk of the same type of alienation that I'm now experiencing. But this is still one of the great mysteries of life to me. Why do people act this way instead of standing up for their own individualism? In my mind, I would never think of excluding someone from a meeting[^3]. If by some unfortunate turn of events, I had been saddled with supervisory responsibilities, I would never in my right mind think of excluding an individual because I had a disagreement with them. I would consider my role to be to provide organization and stability to my team, and not sow discord. Instead of having a feeling of security and routine, I feel like any day I could be out of work, either due to an inability to hack my current situation or because of a personal vendetta someone with a little influence has against me that makes the work day untenable.

People like my current supervisor can also be very destructive. Because of their influence, they can control the reality of what people with little technical knowledge see and know about you. I feel very strongly that what I'm experiencing now is a form of *invalidation*. When this is happening, your skills and actual contributions you can point to simply do not matter[^4]. There is a noticeable lack of communication on our team. Usually, when you have a team of developers, you will get banter back and forth about this and that technique, pattern, etc. That is noticeably absent with my team, and in this particular workplace culture writ large. We do not have code reviews in any form, and as I hinted above, we do not even track projects or user stories. There are no demos, meet ups, or presentations of any kind. On my team, we don't even have a daily standup. This puts the knowledge of who is skilled in what firmly in the realm of personality and hearsay, and hence makes it malleable for purposes of exploitation.

Case in point, I consider myself a full stack developer. This means I have the skills to develop a complete and working application, end-to-end, myself. I work with Java, Spring, and NodeJS. I also leverage technologies like MongoDB, Redis, and RabbitMQ daily. I am adept and proficient at HTML, Javascript, JQuery, and Angular for web development. I regularly keep my skills up to date by working on my own applications, reading books, and taking courses online. I can usually be put anywhere on the stack and work effectively, so I find it hard to imagine that I can't be made use of. I also feel that one of my strongest skills is the ability to communicate in simple and easy to understand terms. I try to communicate in the way that I would like to receive the information. In previous jobs, after a period of getting my feet wet, I am usually asked to give regular presentations and have been praised on many occasions for my adeptness at presenting complex topics, both in verbal and written forms. It's unfortunate that this job and the treatment I'm receiving has sort of deprived me of my voice in this regards.

Situations like this had an easy answer when I was single, but I have a family I have to consider now. My wife also works full time, so we are completely reliant on day care which is a large chunk of our income. I have to make sure that I have a constant source of income, but I also have to make sure I'm doing work that keeps me headed in the right direction so I can speak with authority and experience about my skills. It is common for me to think about jumping ship, staying onboard but looking elsewhere, or just quitting and moving to Cozumel, all in a single moment of reverie.

### Conclusion

If you are going through what I'm describing above, hopefully what you've read gives you a sense that you are not alone, and that there are others who share your experience. This is turning out to be a  pretty dismal experience for me, but I know I can't be alone. I don't know where I'll actually end up a month from now, but I've learned a great deal about the kind of person I want to be.

**Notes**

[^1]: If I recall, I purposefully used the term 'work effort' in actuality to avoid 'user story', which I detect is a loaded term if you're not into agile.
[^2]: There are no cubicles in this office and almost no private space to gather thoughts.
[^3]: Just for context, we're a small team with 4 developers.
[^4]: This is more than likely accompanied by the lack of tracking and documentation I've already alluded to.
