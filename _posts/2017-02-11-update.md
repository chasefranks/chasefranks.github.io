 I wanted to post an update on my status since I haven't really posted anything in a while. I've started a new assignment at work so I've been a little busy, but I intend on getting back to this blog soon.

My new assignment is going great! The team I'm working with is awesome, and I'm finally getting to work with Docker and try out some of its capabilities in a micro services environment. I'm learning a lot every day which may not leave a lot of mental energy for blogging, but I should be able to get a few posts in generalizing some of the new ideas, pitfalls encountered, and DevOps practices from work.

### Stay Tuned

I have been able to do some reading, so stay tuned for a few new book reviews. I also need to build out the "Back to Basics" section of this blog. Here's a few ideas off I've been brewing which will probably motivate my next few posts for that section:

* Linux shell scripting - learning by automating what you do every day
* How does JUnit really run? Making sense of JUnit ```Runner```s.
* Building runnable jars

Feel free to suggest any additional topics in the comments below. Anything you want me to try and unwind for you, I'm happy to give it a go and learn with you along the way.
