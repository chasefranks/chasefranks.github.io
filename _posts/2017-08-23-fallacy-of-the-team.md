title:  "The Fallacy of the Team in Software Development"

intro: >
  Most people imagine software developers working on teams struggling into the night to meet looming deadlines. Usually some type of pizza is involved. I find this picture funny because it is not that way at all. It's unfortunate, because pizza is delicious.

  As an undergraduate engineering major, I heard over and over how important the 'team' was,
  and almost every class I took was immediately organized into teams, to an almost ridiculous degree. In this post, I would like to offer my experience in the work place as a different point of view. What I've found is that it's just not the case that you will be working on a team at all.

## Small People, Majority of the Work

It is more likely the case that you will be tasked with something, and then left to your own devices with little and usually no training. This has been true with the majority of the projects I've worked on. It's mostly solitary work, and your own teammates, if you work with people you consider as such, will have no clue what you're doing. You will usually find that they are engaged in their own projects, and are just as isolated as you.

In fact, I do not even know that many developers at my current job. This is probably because there aren't that many. There are, however, throngs of managers who do nothing but walk around and appear to be busy. What I have observed is that for any piece of software, there is usually one person who actually wrote the code, and a room full managers, project managers, and scrum leaders who want to appear to take credit for it.

Most managers use this pattern to their benefit, which fits right in to a more general pattern of limited visibility and transparency I've observed. Each developer is isolated to their own radically different project. Then the manager walks around to each one and spins their own story with each developer individually. You will find in each one of those conversations political intrigue and scandal, and forms the lonely isolated world the developer has been put in. The reality is that it is all concocted to induce false urgency. People who by their nature are intellectual and work with their heads down simply do not have time for the games.

## Single Throat Pattern

I have also observed that managers, irregardless of whatever nonsense they spew about team, agile, blameless post mortem, etc, will hone in on someone to blame when something goes wrong. Even when they don't have the slightest grasp of how the software works and what actually went wrong, they will make political judgements and investigative inquiries during meetings to figure out who is at fault. Their judgements are based on the tone of people's voices, irrelevant analogies with old out-dated experiences, or other hearsay. I fundamentally do not respect this.

The structuring of the 'team' for assignment of blame usually takes the form of isolating the actual work to a single individual, and you can observe this tendency at work all around you in software. It is called the *single throat to choke* pattern, and it's like a warm blanket for IT managers who don't know what they're doing.

A strong team that shares responsibility for the entire project is the antithesis to this pattern. A bug is everyone's fault, and it simply goes into a queue or backlog for assignment. There should never be a name associated to it, because bugs are going to happen. It's just a reality of software development, and all you are doing is creating emotional baggage for something that is just a day to day occurance and simply requires routine. If your team has the skill set for it, you should rotate positions every other sprint, and yes, even those managers should be rotated out. They are not getting the skills they need being left in the same spot for years and being given a chance to build their fiefdoms.

## The Hero Pattern

Another pattern I've observed is that there is always someone who wants to stand up and appear to be the hero who puts themselves in the line of fire.
