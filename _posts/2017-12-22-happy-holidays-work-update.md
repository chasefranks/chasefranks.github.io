  I don't know how many readers I have out there, but I want to wish everyone happy holidays! I also wanted to post an update on my job hunting endeavors and my plans for the new year.

A bit of good news is in order. I did find a job as a contractor which should keep me occupied for a while, and is a reasonable commute from where I live. I should be starting that at the beginning of the year, and it will hopefully lead to some interesting work.

If I didn't mention it in a previous post, I left my job at AT&T in early October, mostly as an attempt to improve my commute and give me more flexibility with my family and parental responsibilities. Since then I have been actively seeking my next gig, talking to many IT recruiters and employers in the process. Since October, I've had 4 or 5 interviews, and some actually turned into pretty good offers, but they would have involved a worse commute than what I had before.

I think there is a disconnect between out of state employers and those who actually live in the DFW area. I get contacted all the time for jobs in Plano, Richardson, and downtown Dallas, areas which are well beyond a reasonable commute for me. The job I left was in Plano, and I made that commute for over a year. I know all it takes is a single accident along the way, and the commute can be over two hours. Not good when you're a father with a wife who travels frequently and have no family near by. Even when there are no accidents, the traffic density is just horrendous and the way people drive makes it stressful even when the traffic is moving. I'm not sure that looking at Google maps shows what the drive is really like, and I think more employers should be cognizant of what they are asking people to sacrifice.

I was really proud of myself for taking a stand on my commute, and not being enticed by a larger salary or the latest technology. What's the point? I won't have time to go places or have fun anyway! Also, it's very difficult to function at work when you have to use so much energy just to get there.

I want to take a minute and relate some things that are personal to me, but may be helpful for anyone going through a job transition at this time of year. This time in the job market was especially rough, due to the personal and emotional turmoil I experienced at home. It was hard to get my family to accept that I needed to do certain things in order to rearrange life for the better. We can be very cold and calloused towards others at times, and sometimes husbands and wives are the roughest on each other.

People don't talk about this openly, but some day your wife will look at you and say hurtful things when you are at your lowest point. She may denigrate you for quitting a job before you 'have another one'. She may speak to you in a tone that makes you feel like you are on trial. This is an unspoken truth about marriage. Sometimes you feel like nothing more than a 'piggy bank'. You have to shake this off and go into the world with confidence. This one is a tough one, but if people aren't helping you, then you have to forget about them while trying your best to do what is right. Keep the soft and kind-hearted woman you married in your thoughts. Open your heart to her, be vulnerable, and just give it time.

So I want to say to all of the men out there, that if you are going through this you are not alone. You have value independent of any job title, status, or salary. There are other men out there who know what you are going through. If you are going through this world with honor and integrity, trying to provide for your family through an honest trade, you are doing what is right even if the whole world seems against you and there doesn't seem to be a friend in sight.

As for my plans this year, I'm not sure of everything at the moment, but I know that I need to focus on being a better father and husband. I will try to keep this blog updated, maybe once a month, but I'm not sure how much tech I will be writing about. I'm sure to be learning new things in my new job as always, but I have spent a lot of my time and energy in building up my work experience. It is time for me to focus on other aspects of my life, and hopefully achieve more balance.  

Merry Christmas, take good care of yourself, and stick to your principles.
