  I don't know how many readers I have out there, but I want to wish everyone happy holidays! I also wanted to post an update on my job hunting endeavors and my plans for the new year.

A bit of good news is in order. I did find a job as a contractor which should keep me occupied for a while, and is a reasonable commute from where I live. I should be starting that at the beginning of the year, and it will hopefully be some interesting work.

If I didn't mention it in a previous post, I left my job at AT&T in early October and have been in the job market since then. I had personal reasons for leaving, but mostly it was an attempt to improve my commute and give me more flexibility with my family and parental responsibilities. Since then I have been actively seeking my next gig, talking to many IT recruiters and employers, and had 4 or 5 interviews. Some actually turned into pretty good offers, but they would have involved some rough commuting.

I think there is a disconnect between out of state employers and those who actually live in the DFW area. I get contacted all the time for jobs in Plano, Richardson, and downtown Dallas, areas which are well beyond a reasonable commute for me. The job I left was in Plano, and I made that commute for over a year. I know all it takes is a single accident along the way, and the commute can be over two hours. Not good when you're a father with a wife who travels frequently, and have no family near by. Even when there are no accidents, the traffic density is just horrendous and the way people drive makes it stressful even when the traffic is moving. I'm not sure that looking at Google maps shows what the drive is really like, and I think more employers should be cognizant of what they are asking people to sacrifice.

I was really proud of myself for taking a stand on my commute, and not being enticed by a larger salary. What's the point? I won't have time to go places or have fun anyway! Also, it's very difficult to function at work when you have to use so much energy just to get there.

I want to relate some things that are personal to me, but may be helpful for anyone going through a job transition at this time of year. This time in the job market was especially rough, due to some personal and emotional turmoil I experienced at home. It can be hard to get your family to accept that you need to do certain things in order to rearrange your life for the better, even if you have their best interests in mind. We can be very cold and calloused towards others at times, and sometimes husbands and wives are the roughest on each other.

People don't talk about this openly, but some day your wife will look at you and call you 'worthless' when you are at your lowest point. She may denigrate you for quitting a job before you 'have another one'. She may say absolutely horrible things to you in a tone that makes you feel like you are on trial. This is one of the unspoken truths about marriage, and is part of being a husband and being responsible for a family. The holidays are usually a cheerful time, but it goes up and down at times, and it can be especially difficult to transition jobs around the holidays. You have to shake this off and go into the world with confidence. This one is a tough one, but if people aren't helping you, then you have to find a way to forget about them while trying to do what's right. If you have a soft and kind-hearted wife who trusts your decisions, then appreciate her. If you don't, then just forgive her and move on with what you need to do.

I want to say to all of the men out there, that if you are going through all of this, you are *not* worthless. You have value independent of any job title, status, or salary. These are just words, and people will try to use words to hurt. There are other men out there who know what you are going through. If you are going through this world with honor and integrity, trying to provide for your family through an honest trade, you are doing what is right even if the whole world seems against you and there doesn't seem to be a friend in sight.

Merry Christmas, take good care of yourself, and stick to your principles.
