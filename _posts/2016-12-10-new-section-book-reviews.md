{{page.intro}}

These book reviews should hopefully reflect my focus on practical material that I think is going to help me in my job. As such I will try to relate what I'm reading to actual use cases in my job based on what I'm doing today, or achieving goals in pursuit of where I want to be.

Feel free to suggest any other books you think I should read and post a review on. I've fallen out of reading regularly, so I'm looking for any excuse to get back to it.

Also, if you think I've gotten something wrong (which is very likely), set me straight.
