{{page.intro}}

Just a little background on me. I'm a Texas native, born in Corpus Christi, but now live in the Dallas Fort Worth area. I'm a graduate of Texas A&M University where I majored in applied mathematics. I also attended the University of Oklahoma and have a PhD in mathematics from Arizona State University. My interest in programming was sparked while a graduate student. My greatest joy is to spend time with my wife Nina, and Clara my rambunctious two year old daughter.

I started this blog as a creative outlet and a place to communicate my thoughts and ideas. I love searching the internet for solutions to my problems or tutorials to learn a new subject. I want to return the favor and contribute any knowledge I have to the community.

I also do a fair amount of work-life balancing these days. Both my wife and I have busy schedules, and I've found that I've had to become more disciplined in order to juggle the different hats I need to wear.

So please feel free to suggest topics for blog posts, corrections to what I've posted, or anything you're curious about. I'll do my best to post every few days. To get it started, see my [new post](/git/tips/workflow/2016/08/24/git-tip-squash.html) in the "Workflow Wednesdays" series. It describes something I learned about git today...
