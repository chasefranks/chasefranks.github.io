title:  "A Case Against Long Toxic Meetings"

intro: >
  My first blog post of the year is on the thrilling topic of meetings. This has been a long time coming. At most of the places I've worked, I have observed time and time again, people's time used and abused through meetings that ramble on and on and seem to go nowhere. I would like to make a case against these meetings and discuss *why* they go wrong. Maybe through these observations, better ways of interacting with people can be discovered.

## Executive Summary

Let that next meeting out early and let everyone know they are rockstars.

## Why Me?

Why is a software developer talking about meetings?

Let me start by describing my day. Today was a particularly grueling day. I had a 4 hour long meeting right through lunch. The meeting actually went longer, but I was dismissed because my presence was no longer required. No one seemed to care about eating. I looked for the slightest pang of hunger from my teammates, but no one was going to cave. By the end of it, I was weak and shaky, partly from stress but mostly from hunger! I fled to the nearest Taco Cabana I could find.

Sure, I know you have longer meetings all the time.

The thing about this meeting is that the topic revolved mostly around the **allocation of people's time**! Unfortunately, it lasted all day and by the end of it, I could barely focus when I returned from lunch.

The meeting to decide how best to use time to be the most productive...killed me and my productivity today! I'm not making this stuff up. This is a random sample of a random day in corporate America.

Software is a complex endeavor that involves a lot of people who need to communicate. There can be a lot of meetings and a lot of ground to cover at each one. I've seen meetings handled well, but mostly they are not. From my point of view, the best jobs I've had where I've been most productive have been those with the fewest possible meetings, or those that only included me in meetings where I actually belonged and could contribute to the conversation.

This is the point right? Or is the point to waste my time?

## Meetings Are Too Ambitious

I'm a believer that meetings not the proper place to hash things out that haven't been decided already by smaller groups of people.

## Meetings are Too Long

One of the things that I have observed at meetings is that they go on for way too long. I do not believe that people can focus and have meaningful discussion for the length of times attempted at some meetings I've been to. There has to be some optimal length of time that two human beings can communicate, but I think after so many hours they just get tired and end up rambling to each other.

Conversations can often devolve into arguments that seem to go nowhere, and it's clear why this is happening: People are just plain tired. Words get misunderstood, or more often, what I've seen is that some obstacle has arisen and people are trying to talk their way through it, forgetting that they've already been at it for several hours. Everyone around can tell when the discussion is coming apart because the environment gets tense.

I'm convinced that people are just overworked and need some rest to regain clarity. There's no reason to try and fix everything, and remember, the world will go on without you. Call that meeting early, letting everyone know that it's because they did a good job, and give everyone a break.

## People Forget To Be Polite

Many of the ills that plague meetings can be combated by just remembering to value people and their time again, and be polite to them. I'm new in my current job, and the people there just start in, without describing what the meeting is even about. They throw around all sorts of internal corporate vernacular with each other, never bothering to explain anything to anyone outside of the circle. They just don't get it that they are incomprehensible to anyone who hasn't been there 20 years, and from what I've seen, they even confuse each other sometimes.

Another thing I've seen is that people just cut each other off or interrupt each other. Forgetting to be polite, they treat people like shit just because they work with them. This is where I get off the bus. Everyone around me is a person who deserves decency, regardless of how long I've been working with them. Conversation is a give and take. I talk a little, then you talk a little, then etc.
